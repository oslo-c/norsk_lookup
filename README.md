```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oslo-c/norsk_lookup.git
cd norsk_lookup

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development

Run directly with Python:
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

### Building

Build the executable:
```bash

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Hotkey not working?

- Try restarting the application

### No translation popup appears?
- Ensure you've **highlighted** the text before pressing the hotkey
- Try selecting just a single word
- Check that you have an internet connection (required for dictionary lookups)

### Popup appears on wrong monitor?
- This should be automatic - if it's not working, please report a bug!

### App not starting with Windows?
- Open Task Manager ‚Üí Startup tab
- Enable "Norwegian Dictionary Lookup"
- Or reinstall and check the startup option
